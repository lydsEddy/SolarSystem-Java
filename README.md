Building an OO Model of the Solar System

There are three main types of object in the solar system. There are suns, planets and moons. Note that
these are similar in many ways - they will all have a name, colour, diameter and location, but have
different behaviour. Suns don't move, planets orbit the sun and moons orbit planets.
